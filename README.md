# Automatic-Birthday-Wisher-To-Auto-Wish-Friends

We need to create a task scheduler task which will run our main.py file on 12:00 am everyday so that it can check and wish that person on their respective birthday.
To do that, you need to copy the path of the file.
Now open the task scheduler.
Now you need to click on  create a task and then triggers.
Now click on new and set that as daily and time as 00:00:00 (for 12 am).
Now get back to the general tab and add name and description.
Now go to action then new and then click on browse.
Now on program/script click browse and then choose python.exe by browsing and for arguments just paste the path of the file within the double quote.
Now press ok and exit it.


**Thanks**
